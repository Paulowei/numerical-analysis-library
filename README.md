# Numerical-Analysis Library  ;   

- The project entails the use of data structures and algorithms in Java to replicate the numerical iteration methods used to solve polynomial equations,
Including NewtonRaphson Iteration , Bisection Iteration, FixedPointIteration  , and Lagrange Interpolation .

- Prerequisites ; 
- Java 11 or above ; Maven 3.8.5  ;
  
- To compile the project ; 
- Use the following command ; 
- mvn compile ;
  
- To package the project to a Jar (Java Archive) 
- Use the following command ;
- mvn package  ;
  
- change directories to the /target folder
- where the .jar (Java Archive ) file is found,  ;
- The name of the file should be "numerical-analysis-2.6.jar"  ;
  
- To interact with the terminal ;
- Use the following command ;
- As for Lagrange interpolation,  polynomials are expressed as arrays of pairs of double values (List<double[]>) 
- To perform lagrange  interpolation with the following pairs of x:y values (2:3 3:4 4:5) ;
- java -jar "numerical-analysis-2.6.jar" "Interpolation" 2:3 3:4 4:5

- As for the remaining types of iteration , polynomials are expressed as arrays of pairs of double and integer values (List<Pair<Double,Integer>>)
- The Pair class (com.moderneinstein.logical.numerical.Pair) , it is a central figure within this API , and helps to represent expressions of powers of unknowns  ;
- For example, The expression 4z^3 could be expressed as Pair<Double,Integer> temps = new Pair<Double,Integer>(4.0,3) , it remains implemented as a Generic Template Object, and it extends Cloneable,Comparable<Pair<N,M>> ; 
- The first value in each pair represents the co-efficient of that term , and the second value represents the power of x in that term ;
- So the polynomial  2x^3 + 3x^4 + 4x^5  will be represented as  2:3 3:4 4:5 , likewise the polynomial 4x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 
- could be represented   4:2 3:3 2:4  , in any order, as there are alogrithms that will handle the sorting accordingly ;
-  
- To perform   Bisection iteration with the following pairs of x:y values (2:3 3:4 4:5) ;
- java -jar "numerical-analysis-2.6.jar" "Bisection" 2:3 3:4 4:5

 - To perform Newton Raphson iteration with the following pairs of  values (2:3 3:4 4:5) ;
- java -jar "numerical-analysis-2.6.jar" "NewtonRaphson" 2:3 3:4 4:5

 - To perform lagrange  Fixed Point Iteration with the following pairs of x:y values (2:3 3:4 4:5) ;
- java -jar "numerical-analysis-2.6.jar" "FixedPointIteration" 2:3 3:4 4:5
